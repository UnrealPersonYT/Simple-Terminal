## Version
The current version is v1.0.0.

## Build
Simply run `make` from the main folder for a fast compile on Windows, Linux, & Mac.  
Supports g++, clang, and MSVC (g++ recommended).

## Development
This is not supposed to be blazingly fast, but is highly modular, making it easy to implement new features or modules.

## Status
Very experimental.

## What Is A Module?
A module is a data structure containing a command name for fast lookup,  
a brief description of what it does, and a command to process arguments (also called a digest).

## Simple Modules
These modules are simple examples and can be used as a reference:
- echo
- exit
